# Registration Form Project
This repository contains a simple registration form project developed using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB.
The project consists of the main registration form (index.html), a success page for successful registrations (signup_successful.html), the styling for the pages (style.css), and the server-side logic (index.js) to handle form submissions and store user information in MongoDB.

## Project Structure
- *index.html*: The main registration form that users fill out to sign up. It includes fields for Name, Age, Email, Phone Number, Gender, and Password.
- *signup_successful.html*: The success page displayed after a user successfully registers. It includes a message and a background image.
- *style.css*: Stylesheet for formatting and styling the HTML pages. It uses the 'Poppins' font and includes styles for the registration form and success page.
- *index.js*: Node.js script to handle server-side logic. It uses Express for handling HTTP requests, Body Parser for parsing request bodies, and Mongoose to interact with MongoDB. The script establishes a connection to the database and handles POST requests to the "/sign_up" endpoint, storing user information in the 'users' collection.
